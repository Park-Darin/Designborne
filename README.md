# Designborne: A Rogue-like Game Project

## Introduction

Welcome to Designborne, a text-based rogue-like game inspired by popular titles such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Bloodborne. This project was developed as part of the FIT2099 - Object Oriented Design and Implementation unit at Monash University. The game features elements reminiscent of these games, including similar characters, items, and locations, adapted for educational purposes.

## Project Overview

For the duration of the semester, I worked on this relatively large software project to design and implement new functionalities into an existing system. The project was divided into three main assignments, each building upon the previous one. The assignments focused on iterative design, development, and testing to ensure a well-developed and refined game system.

## General Background

Rogue-like games are a genre of role-playing games characterized by random level generation, turn-based gameplay, and permanent death of the player character. They originated from the game "Rogue," which was popular in the early days of home computing. Despite the evolution of graphics in modern games, rogue-like games maintain a dedicated following due to their challenging and strategic nature.

## Designborne

Designborne draws inspiration from the dark and challenging worlds of games like Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Bloodborne. The project utilized concepts from these games to help visualize and implement the required features. All linked game content, videos, and images belong to their respective owners and are used for educational purposes with proper credit.

## How to Play Designborne

Below are some screenshots and descriptions of the implemented features in Designborne:

### 1. Initial Map and Player Spawn

When you start the game, your character will spawn in the initial map. Here’s what you need to do:

#### Move South: Head south to find and collect the Broadsword("1"), a powerful weapon essential for your survival.

### Assignments Breakdown

#### First project: Initial Implementation

In Assignment 1, the primary focus was on implementing the initial features of the game. This involved understanding the provided codebase, extracting the required game features, and iteratively designing and testing the system. The initial codebase was provided through a repository on git.infotech.monash.edu, and extensive support was available through Ed Lesson modules.


#### Second Project: Enhanced Features and Documentation

Assignment 2 expanded on the initial implementation by adding more complex features and requiring the submission of design documents, including interaction diagrams (sequence or communication diagrams). This phase involved refining the game mechanics and ensuring better game flow and functionality.


#### Third project: Final Features and Polishing

In Assignment 3, the focus was on finalizing the game by adding the remaining features, polishing existing ones, and ensuring overall game stability. This phase required extensive testing and debugging to deliver a robust and engaging game experience.

## Conclusion

The Designborne project was a comprehensive exercise in object-oriented design and implementation, allowing for practical application of theoretical concepts. Through iterative development and detailed design documentation, the project provided a robust framework for developing complex software systems.
